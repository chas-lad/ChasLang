# ChasLang


- Lexer does tokenisation (recognises words that make up the language)
- Parser recognises the structure and grammar - uses Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to give intermediate representation of source code as a tree structure.
- Source code -> FrontEnd(Parser and Lexer) -> AST(IR) -> Backend () -> Output

- No need for all the fancy setup C requires.

- dynamic type recognition
